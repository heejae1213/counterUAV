A. Forget about hardware --> totally screwed, will need few months, maybe <br />
B. Focus on Kalman filter (as I told at the first time) <br />
  --> noise reduction <br />
    + add various types of noise --> various kinds of random (gaussian.. and so on...), harmonicish (refer harmonics in music) <br />
      a. test **robustness** of our algorithm <br />
        1. increase intensity of the nosie from 1/10 of max signal --> 1 of max --> 11/10 of max signal <br />
        2. check if our algorithm has ability to distinguish received signal and noise --> until with how much intensity <br />
 <br />
      b. study **noise reduction** <br />
        1. increase intensity of the nosie from 1/10 of max signal --> 1 of max -- > 11/10 of max signal <br />
        2. add noise reduction term before the data converted by fft <br />
        3. before do fft, check if the noise reduced significantly but signal is survived --> open wave file using audacity or relevant software <br />
        4. then do fft, test increase of target recognition, reduction of target recognition range <br />
 <br />
C. Velocity calculation using FMCW --> total new for me and in this field (FMCW radar), need to study too... <br />
